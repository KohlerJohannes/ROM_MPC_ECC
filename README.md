## Description

This repository contains the MATLAB code that accompanies the paper 
>  Johannes Köhler, Carlo Scholz, Melanie Zeilinger "Robust reduced-order model predictive control: Peak-to-peak gain & filtered signals", 2025, [Add arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx).


## Prerequisites

- [MATLAB](https://de.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)  
- [YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io/)  
- [Mosek](https://www.mosek.com/)  
- [Casdadi](https://web.casadi.org/)  

## Usage

* Run `main.m` to set up the model, generate reduced-order model, analysis peak-to-peak gain, solve MPC problem, and generate plots.

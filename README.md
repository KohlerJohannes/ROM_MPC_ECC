# A model-free approach to control barrier functions for high order systems

## Description

This repository contains the MATLAB code that accompanies the paper 
 "A model-free approach to control barrier functions for high order
systems", 2026, [ArXiv link](https://arxiv.org/...).


## Prerequisites

- [MATLAB](https://de.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)  
- [Casdadi](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/robotics.html)  

## Usage

Run `main.m` to run simulations; where you can toggle on the CBF or run a pure funnel controller
`setup.m` loads the robot dyanmics, designs initial and final configuration and makes corresponding plot
`makeplots.m` generate the plots and provides quantitative metrics
